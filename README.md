Mostly miscellaneous code from daily stuff.

See beam-graphene directory for the older simulation code and example usage for *Laser Beams Masked by Semi-ablated Saturable Absorbant Surfaces*, there are also some old preliminary reports. See https://github.com/serinos/beam-graphene for more recent work done on the project.
